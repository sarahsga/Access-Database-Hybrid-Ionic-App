# Access-Database-Hybrid-Ionic-App
It is a Hybrid Mobile application that uses Ionic Framework and ngCordova. It fetches records from a huge Access database stored in SD-card as an SQLite database, and displays it on your mobile screen.

The original database has not been included in this repo on client's request
